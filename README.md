## Task 01

In package [com.softserveinc.task01](src/main/java/com/softserveinc/task01) create a public class `CoffeeMachineV1` derived 
from [AbstractCoffeeMachine](src/main/java/com/softserveinc/task01/AbstractCoffeeMachine.java).

You need implement the methods `makeEspresso()` and `makeAmericano()`. Both methods should invoke method `makeCoffee()` defined
in parent class `AbstractCoffeeMachine`.

To create `Espresso` it is needed 22 g of coffee beans and 30 ml of water.

To create `Americano` it is needed 22 g of coffee beans and 100 ml of water.
